IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER FOR MUSHROOM CLASSIFICATION SOFTWARE
=========================================================

This software is designed for EDUCATIONAL and RESEARCH purposes only.

WARNING: The authors and contributors of this software assume NO LIABILITY
whatsoever for any harm, injury, illness, or death that may result from
using the predictions or classifications made by this software.

CRITICAL SAFETY INFORMATION:

1. NEVER consume wild mushrooms based solely on predictions from this or
   any AI/ML software.

2. Many edible mushrooms have deadly poisonous lookalikes that can be
   nearly impossible to distinguish without expert knowledge.

3. Mushroom poisoning can cause severe illness, organ failure, and death.

4. Always consult with expert mycologists and use multiple reliable
   identification methods before consuming any wild mushroom.

5. When in doubt, throw it out. No meal is worth risking your life.

BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:

- You understand the extreme risks of consuming misidentified wild mushrooms
- You will not rely on this software for definitive mushroom identification
- You accept full responsibility for any decision to consume wild mushrooms
- The authors and contributors are not liable for any consequences of using
  this software

This software is intended as a learning tool for understanding machine
learning, mycology, and classification systems - NOT as a field guide for
foraging edible mushrooms.
